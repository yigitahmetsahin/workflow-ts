# Branching Policy (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS start a NEW branch from `main` for EVERY change.**

Before starting ANY work:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

## Rules

- NEVER reuse or add commits to an existing branch
- NEVER continue working on someone else's branch
- Each task/fix/feature gets its own fresh branch
- If on an existing branch that isn't `main`, switch to `main` first

## Branch Naming

- Features: `feat/<short-description>`
- Bug fixes: `fix/<short-description>`
- Refactors: `refactor/<short-description>`
- Docs: `docs/<short-description>`

See @AGENTS.md for full branching policy details.
